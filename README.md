Files for Just Intonation music sequencer

Components of current Just Intonation music sequencer used by David Ryan:

1) JI notation system using ASCII text
2) Excel spreadsheet
3) CSV sequence file
4) Octave (or MATLAB) code to turn CSV into audio output
5) Audio output in terms of .mp3 or .wav files

NOTE 17th JUNE 2015:

This GitHub repository is intended to allow public shared work and collaboration on my Just Intonation music sequencer. The files will uploaded soon... Soon means in the next few months, since with full time work I don't have a lot of time to devote to writing chip-tune music... But it will happen! DR

NOTE 3rd Sept 2015

JI notation paper available now at: http://arxiv.org/pdf/1508.07739.pdf
Some example notation text files have been uploaded here.
Some example sequenced files (for input to sequencer_v08) uploaded here
The music sequencer (MATLAB/Octave code) uploaded.
Note - this sequencer requires a whole bunch of function files to be uploaded too, and I haven't yet succeeded in uploading a whole directory at once! DR
