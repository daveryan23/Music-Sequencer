# Scope of Project
Creating a Music Sequencer using:
- Excel for sequencing the notes, into CSV format
- MATLAB (or Octave, its free!) for turning CSV data
  into a series of .wav audio files, 1 for each channel
- Audacity for mixing the different .wav files together.

# What I did
The Excel and MATLAB have been developed across approx 2015-2017.

Although this repo has been updated extensively in Oct 2017,
my original example files are retained, in 'original_examples' directory.

# Tools I used
- Excel (sequencing)
- MATLAB (processing)
- Audacity (post-processing)

# Result
Lots of music files!
