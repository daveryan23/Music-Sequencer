Components of current Just Intonation music sequencer used by David Ryan:

NOTE on 17th JUNE 2015:

This GitHub repository is intended to allow public shared work and collaboration on my Just Intonation music sequencer. The files will uploaded soon... Soon means in the next few months, since with full time work I don't have a lot of time to devote to writing chip-tune music... But it will happen! DR
